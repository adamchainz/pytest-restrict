History

Pending Release
---------------

* New release notes here
* Changed the format of ``--restrict-types`` to take a comma-separated list of
  import paths rather than space separated, which fixes the parsing of e.g.
  ``py.test --restrict-types my.TestCase run/these/test_files.py``.

1.0.0 (2016-04-17)
------------------

* First release on PyPI
